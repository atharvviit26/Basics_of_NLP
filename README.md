### **Product Backlog**

The **Product Backlog** is a prioritized list of tasks or features (user stories) that need to be completed for the system to be functional. Each user story is ranked by its priority and estimated effort, defined as "story points."

| **ID** | **User Story**                                                                                   | **Priority** | **Story Points** |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------|
| **US1** | As a student, I want to register and create an account so that I can log in to the system.         | High         | 5                |
| **US2** | As a student, I want to fill in my personal and educational details in the application form.       | High         | 8                |
| **US3** | As a student, I want to upload my certificates (e.g., marksheets, ID proof) for verification.      | High         | 8                |
| **US4** | As an admin, I want to view submitted applications so that I can review them.                      | High         | 7                |
| **US5** | As an admin, I want to approve or reject applications based on the eligibility criteria.           | Medium       | 6                |
| **US6** | As an admin, I want to provide a reason for rejection so that students can correct their mistakes.  | Medium       | 5                |
| **US7** | As a student, I want to receive a notification about the approval or rejection of my application.   | Medium       | 6                |
| **US8** | As a student, I want to edit and resubmit my application if it gets rejected.                      | Medium       | 5                |
| **US9** | As an admin, I want to view a dashboard showing pending and processed applications.                | Low          | 7                |

### **Explanation of Key Stories:**

1. **US1 (Account Registration)**: High-priority user story as it's the starting point for every student. Without this, no one can access the system.
2. **US2 (Application Form)**: Critical for the core functionality, allowing students to apply by entering their personal and educational information.
3. **US4 (Admin Application Review)**: Admin's ability to review applications is central to the system.
4. **US5 (Application Approval/Rejection)**: Admin must be able to accept or reject applications, forming a key part of the workflow.
5. **US8 (Resubmission)**: This adds flexibility, allowing students to resubmit after making corrections based on admin feedback.

This **Product Backlog** provides a clear list of the tasks to be completed, sorted by priority. Each user story is written in a way that focuses on the end-user's goals, a key part of the Scrum process.

### **Sprint Backlog**

The **Sprint Backlog** is a subset of the Product Backlog that the team commits to complete during a specific sprint. For this project, we will assume the sprint duration is **2 weeks**, and we'll focus on key user stories that can be implemented within that time.

### **Sprint Breakdown Explanation:**

- **US1 (User Registration)**: This is essential for enabling users to access the system. Tasks include designing the registration form and implementing authentication in Django.
- **US2 (Application Form)**: The core feature of the system, requiring both UI development and backend form handling.
- **US3 (Document Upload)**: A critical feature allowing students to upload documents. It involves building the file upload feature and ensuring security through validation.
- **US4 (Admin Dashboard)**: Allows admins to view applications. It will involve designing the UI and developing the backend to list the applications.

### **Sprint Goals:**
- By the end of Sprint 1, we aim to have the student registration, application form, document upload, and a basic admin dashboard implemented.

**Explanation**:  
- The **Estimated Work Remaining** is the expected reduction of work over time, whereas the **Actual Work Remaining** tracks the real progress made.
